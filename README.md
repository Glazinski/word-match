# WordMatch

### First of all game is based on:

-  [Wordshake](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/general-english/games/wordshake) by BritishCoucil
-  [SÅ‚owotok](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.slowotok.app&hl=en) by SpringLabs

### For word matching I use

-  [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)
